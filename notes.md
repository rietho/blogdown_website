## Blog Post Ideas

-   Pretenses (Vorwände) instead of arguments in discussions
-   We are making lots of assumptions in daily life / conversations
-   Sender-Receiver model: intention, said, heard, understood (many things can go wrong, we are often stuck with what was said)
-   What we think we want and what we actually want
-   The future is a function of the past
-   There is no free will, but only free non-will
-   How we trick ourselves with memories
-   Advantages of awareness
-   How things are vs. how we want them to be (acceptance)
-   The issue of outpacing but not outrunning evolution
-   Being poor is expensive
-   Goals are a tool to help you go in the right direction
    -   It is helpful to understand where you are and which direction you want to go
    -   Goals as a tool are often misused
-   Positions vs. interests / needs
    -   Positions are often expressed with the intention to serve a need. But that is flawed
        -   the position might not fulfill the need, you might not even know what the need is
        -   even if position fulfills the need, it is just one position. typically there are many positions that can fulfill a need. positions are very limiting, but needs open up a lot of possibilities.
-   Fundamental attribution error
