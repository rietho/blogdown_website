  This blog is, well, about "minding" and "gaps". In mindfullness you wanna
  mind, not so much a gap, but the here and now. However, that can help
  to mind the gap between what you do and what you want to do. In people
  management you definitely also want to mind the gap between how you act
  and the behaviours you actually want to show. Finally, when analysing data
  it's crucial to mind the gap between how you summarise your data (e.g. by
  a model), the data itself and the story you tell.
  
  So, you see all these topics are *well* related ;)
