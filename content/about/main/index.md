  This blog is, well, about "gaps" and "minds". I'm starting this as a blogging experiment. 
  The content will be about topics that are of interest to me evolving around 
  data science (in a broad sense), management and mental health. 
  I hope you like some of my content. Comments and suggestions are warmly welcomed.
