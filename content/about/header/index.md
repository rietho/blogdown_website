<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm an Austrian :flag-at: living in Germany :de: after having lived in Ireland :flag-ie: for 6 years and working in the data industry. My educational background is in mathematics, statistics and conflict management. On this blog, I write about topics I'm passionate about. At least for a start, my posts will revolve around 3 main themes:

1. Data science and in particular the R programming language
2. People management and leadership
3. Mental health with a focus on mindfulness

Also good to mention: I'm a big fan of the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/). Therefore, this site is built with the R package [blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/)).

See my [CV](/cv/) to learn more about my professional background. Note: The CV was created with R as well :smile:
