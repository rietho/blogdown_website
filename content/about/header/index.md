<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm an Austrian :flag-at: living in Ireland :flag-ie:. Professionally, I'm a mathematician working in Business Intelligence at [Indeed.com](https://indeed.com/). This blog is an experiment where I'll write about topics of interest to me. At least for a start, these will evolve around data analytics, R, management and mental health.

Also good to mention: I'm a big fan of the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/). Therefore, this site is built with the R package [blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/)).
