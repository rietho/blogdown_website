<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm an Austrian :flag-at: living in Ireland :flag-ie: and working in the tech industry. MY educational background is in mathematics, statistics and conflict management. Currently, I work in Business Intelligence at [Indeed.com](https://indeed.com/). On this blog I write about topics I'm passionate about. At least for a start, my posts will evolve around data science and in particular the R programming language, people management and leadership as well as mental health with a focus on mindfulness.

Also good to mention: I'm a big fan of the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/). Therefore, this site is built with the R package [blogdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/)).

See my [CV](/cv/) to learn more about my professional background. Note: The CV was created with R as well :smile:
