**TLDR**: This is a brief overview on how you can also build your own blog. I'll mostly share my own story, but also point out some alternatives. The rebuild what I did, you could simply follow [this guide](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app/start/).

## Motivation

You might ask yourself, why create a blog in the first place. Well, it depeneds on your interestes and motivations. Here's a brief intro into my story:

I always thought that it would be a great project to create a blog to write about stuff that is of interest to me. I find it very beneficial for my learning process to write about things of interest to me. It forces me to put a structure around it, how to explain it to others and fill in gaps with research.

Moreover, I regularly came across pormissing projects to make website building easy and fun. That was most importantly the R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). Creating a blog using blogdown comes with a bunch of features:

-   Create a blog powered (amongst others) by R. That is, I can easily use my favourite IDE [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), I can integrate R code in my blog and I can benefit from the supportive R community.
-   Use all the advantages of git version control with all it's advantages like branching along with free hosting of all my code on [Github](https://github.com/rietho/blogdown_website).
-   Benefit from all the tooling blogdown is powered by like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as well as tools ths allows me to connect to like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
