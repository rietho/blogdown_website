**TLDR**: The "Gap the Mind" blog n experiment and a journey on writing about data analytics, management and mental health.

* About the name
  * gaps and the mind
  * originates from mind the gap, but often thinks are twisted. And mind the gap is used already quite a lot.
  * gap the mind: in todays world many of us are focused a lot on using our mind to guide us through life. seems far too narrow minded. don't get me wrong, mind brought us far and will bring us even further. but on it's own, we're limiting ourselves a lot. I'll call that *gap the mind*.
* How ww might wanna gap the mind in the 3 main topics I intend to write about:
    * data anyltics: 
    * management: 
    * mental health:
