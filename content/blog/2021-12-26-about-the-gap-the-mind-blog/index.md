For me, as for many other people writing about topics I'm interested in, helps me get a deeper understanding of them. On top of that, sharing the wirting with others adds some benefits. That is, I'm not just wirting for myself, but with an audience in mind. Explaning things to others helps expose to myself where I have knowledge gaps. And ultimately, sharing with others makes my knowledge accessible to others. All of that along with the fun of [creating a blog and doing so with R](/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-blog-using-r-and-blogdown/) is enough reason for writing this blog.

## About the blog name

There are a 6 great reasons why the name of this blog is "Gap the Mind". These relate mostly to the topics I wanna write about, but are also pragmatic. And, to be honest, I partly came up with some reasons after I found the name.

1. **This blog is about gaps and the mind**<br>
  As I'll describe later, the topics I wanna write about are all in some sense about gaps and the mind. But to summarise it here: Gaps to bridge are everywhere. And in todays world we use our mind to solve pretty much every problem. The later is too often even the case if our mind is not the right tool for the problem.

2. **The name originates from "Mind the Gap"** -- suprise :astonished: --, **but often things are upside down**<br>
  "Mind the Gap" refers to many things. There are literal gaps in the ground like in the underground or mental gaps like between what you mean and what others understand. Ideally, we wanna mind these gaps. That is at least be aware of them and ideally not fall into them. At the same time, things are often mixed up. Let's look at a fictional person named Gary for examples. Let's say Gary falls into a gap in the ground like a construction hole. Gary might think that the gap should not have been there in the first place. That is like Gary feels he does not need to mind gaps, because they should not be here. Or Gary might say that someone else should mind the gap for him via security measures. Of course security is important, but that does not mean that we don't need to mind any gaps any more. Or lets say Gary is misunderstood by his friend and argues that it's the fault of his friend. His friend did understood his words "wrong". And Gary's friend might say that Gary said the "wrong" words.

3. **"Mind the Gap" is used way to often on the internet**<br>
  Originally I thought about naming the blog "Mind the Gap". But too many blogs and sites use this name already. So, I simply needed something else.

4. **Mindfulness**<br>
  Early 2021 I started getting interested in Mindfulness. I like to think of Mindfulness as a practice for training your mind to help you be mindful where needed. Obviously, we wanna be mindful of gaps that we wanna mind. But Mindfulness is actually about using more than just your mind. It's about using your senses and being aware of emotions and feelings as they arise. In some sense mindfulness it not at all about minding gaps. That is gaps in the sense of the difference between where we are and where we wanna be. Mindfulness is more about minding where we are.

5. **Gap the mind**<br>
  "Gap" is unfortunately not a verb. But let's not get hung up on details and understand "gap" in terms of "to bridge the gap to". That way we can understand "gap the mind" as "bridge the gap to the mind". And there are many gaps between our mind and other things. That is for example between the mind and our emotions, our actions, our words, other peoples perception, the results we achive and so on.

6. **The domain is already bought**<br>
  As I figured "gap the mind" is a good enough name, I just went with it and bought the domain `gapthemind.info`. `.info`, because it was one of the cheapest [top level domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain). And now that it is bought, I wanna think that [I went for the best option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias).
