Ideas:

* Radical and maybe seemingly counterituitive idea. But stay with me ...
* Simple explanation of idea: Happiness coming from being you right here right now. That is with everything you sense everything you feel, even if some of it is unpleasant. Just being and having nothing to do.
* Why happiness from doing is always temporary.
* A view that helps me is to distinguish two modes we can be in: Being vs. doing
  * doing mode being part of being mode
  * influence each other
  * but always part of being that is not affected by doing
* How to be?
  * Involves doing and needs training.
* Does all of above make sense?
  * Maybe, maybe not
  * Experiencing it for yourself is critical in my experience. 


TLDR: In the western world we define ourselves and others through what we achieve and what we have. We pursue goeals to achieve happiness which is always temporary. A contrary and somewhat idea is that we can achieve happiness and contentment simply via being. This post follows this idea to explore if and how it might actually help us being happy.

## Motivation

<img src="being-happy-featured.png" alt="Photo of me, Thomas, with a forest, lawn and path in the background under blue sky. A speechbuble saying: 'Here I am! And now I'm happy?'" width="100%"/>

The photo shows me, as far as I can remember, actually feelkng very happy. And that is despite the time of the photo was taken being a quite difficult one.
