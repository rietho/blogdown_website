## Blogging and data privacy? Sounds boring

> "Data privacy is challenging since it attempts to use data while protecting an individual's privacy preferences and personally identifiable information." <br>([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy))

Data privacy is not only challenging, but also very important. We all want our own data be well protected and treatd with care. That is especially when it comes to very sensitive data like health records or credit card details. But also data on which websites we visit on the internet would not be great to float around the internet.

Whilst there are many [tips on how to stay safe on the web](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-stay-safe-web), also lawmakers [started tackling online privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy_law). When I started blogging, I suddenly found myself on the side of a website provider being responsible for any data collected on my blog. Slowly, I started to realise that this raises many questions. What do I need to do? What can't I do? What am I responsible for?

All of that sounds quite boring. At least to me. And, when I started digging into the topic, it was actually quite boring. However, it is very important. Not only for me as blogger, but more importantly as I have a responsibility towards everyone visiting my website.

## What to watch out for

There is a lot to potentially watch out for. And if you wanna be on the save side, you might want to consult a lawyer. That is especially if you earn money from your blog.

In my case, I am hosting a website using the Hugo framework, which creates a static website. A static website is a website "that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page)). This makes my case simpler, as I am not collecting any data myself. In my understanding, I need to watch out for any third party Javascript based content content I am embedding.

Here are some exmaples I cam across:

* Embedded GIFs
* Twitter cards
* Youtube videos
* Google Analytics

## What to do

This is the very tricky part. In the end, what to do depends on many factors like the type of embedded content, the country you are based in or the country of your users. In short: It's complicated.

*Side note: I studied math. So above Meme is not that far from what I did back in university. That is at except for the suite. So, from my perspective, data privacy laws are actually much more complicated than math.*

### The simple solution

The simplest solution to me seems to be to not collect any data at all. That is not by myself and not by any third party. For a static website, this means not embedding any third party content that is tracking data. Sounds easy and is also easy. The challenge is, that this approach comes with limitations. Not using any website analytics tool means that you can't see how many people visit your site. Not embedding social media postings or GIFs means fewer opportunities to loosen up your content.

When using Hugo, there are actually some very easy and great ways how to still embed third party content without having them track any data. By simply setting a few parameters you can control privacy settings for popular third party content like Google Analytics, Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo or Youtube. See [here](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/) for more infos. For some third parties, Hugo actually offers a `simple`-mode, which means that Hugo creates a pure HTML version of the content that does not come with any tracking. I am not a 100% sure, but these settings may only apply when using [Hugo's Shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#tweet). Here is an example for Twitter:

{{< tweet user="Headspace" id="1492510305058004994" >}}

### The not so simple solution

When you do want to use third party content, things get a bit trickier. It is my understanding that when EU's [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (General Data Protection Regulation) applies, the user needs to explicitly consent to data collection before it happens. Not just that, the user also needs to be informed about what data is collected and for what reasons. If data is collected, the user needs to be able to access all that about them being stored and needs to be able to request for it to be deleted. One result of this is that we see a lot of cookie consent banners on websites.

there is any cookies are created, a cookie consent banner is needed. The idea is that a user needs to explicitly agree to cookies before they can be used. That is at least for non-essential cookies.

In the case of my blog, I am currently using Google Analytics.
