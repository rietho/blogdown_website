Mindfulness has become an important topic for myself in the last year. Here, I wanna share a bit more about my story and my views on mindfulness. I myself attribute huge benefits to mindfulness. And I want to do my bit in sharing these with others to maybe help someone out there. Moreover, there seem to be many misconceptions about mindfulness. Hopefully, I can help to clear some of these up as well.

# Mindfulness?

Before diving into my story, I provide some high level insights into my understanding of mindfulness. That is, as I feel there are not only misconceptions, but very different understandings of what mindfulness is.

TODO: look up "definition"

When I think of mindfulness, there are a few related aspects that are important to me:

## **Awareness**

?Blog post name?  
Keen on knowing what is happening with yourself? Try awareness

I'd say the core of mindfulness is awareness. This is well conveyed by the following definition of mindfulness:

> *Being aware of what is happening while it is happening*   
> (source TBD)

This may sound incredibly simple and as a concept it is. But it is by no means easy to do. Let me give you an example to showcase how much there is to be aware of in every single moment of life. Let's say you are walking down the street. You got up late and you are late for work. This may case many emotions like stress because you don't want to be late. You might be angry at yourself because you woke up late again. You may also be angry at your flatmate because he occupied the bathroom for 30min. You might also be worried because of that assignment due today and not yet finished. You might also be thinking about the date you had last night and wondering what impression you made. You want to get it right, because this may lead to a promotion. There might also be cars, bikes and other pedestrians passing by. There might be a mix of clouds and clear sky and some dark clouds on the horizon. There might also be various birds around chirping and going minding their morning routine. And there may be so much more. But do you think that you'd be aware of all of that?

One very important aspect of awareness is being vs. doing. Just think about above the situation walking down the street. Usually, while walking, we are thinking about what to do about stuff in the future, e.g. the work assignment, or things in the past, e.g. the date. This state of wanting to do something, about achieving goals or rumination is called *doing mode*. In doing mode one typically want to do something. On the contrary, in *being mode* one is experining the present moment. That might be sensations like temperature, a breeze on your skin, birds chirping and so on. Thus, basically "raw" sensations through ones senses. By "raw" I am referring to the sensation e.g. of the sound itself. That is as experiences trigger a lot of reactions like interpretations, memories or emotions. For example the sound of a bird chirping. Identifying the sound as a bird chirping is already an interpretation. At the same time, this may make you feel comnfortable, it might remind you of last summer when you were sitting in a park and so on. But being also includes experiencing ones emotions or thoughts. There is an extremely experience rich world happening in every moment inside and outside yourself.

There are different types of awareness. One way to categorize is (source: Institute of you, TBD):

-   Self awareness
-   Social awareness
-   Organisational awareness

But there are also different types of self awareness. One categorization I came across is from the book "Executive Presence" by ... (search for "Eurich", TBD):

-   External self awareness
-   Internal self awareness
-   Strategic self awareness

I wanna call out that awareness and esp. self awareness ist not just to have. Self awareness is a skill that comes with huge benefits. It basically gives you the possibility to respond to what is happening rather than just reacting. Think for example about a customer at a hotel reception screaming and shouting at the receptionist because they are unhappy with their room. Most likely that person is just reacting and being led by their emotions. With self awareness they could have observed that they feel anger enabling them to decide what to do next. A person could decide to take some time to calm down, to breathe and to think about what they want to do next to resolve the situation they are in.

Being aware of your own emotions and allowing you to respond is huge in itself. But self awareness can help you with many other aspects like realizing own biases, observing your own habits, observing how you communicate, how you make decisions, what actually makes you happy and fulfilled, how experiences and memories shape our decision making and a lot more. If you wanna hear more about the advantages of self awareness, please leave a comment.

## Meditation

Meditation is closely related to mindfulness. In my understanding meditation is a practice that can be used to train being mindful. In other words, meditation can be used as a practice and training of the mind and the brain.

Mindfulness meditation is, in my understanding, a special form of meditation.

Ambiguity of meditation.

To me the practice and training part is very important.

## Philosophy

-   relationship to buddhism
-   we are all interconnected
-   overestimating the importance of self (ego)
-   Helping yourself to help yourself
-   joy of the moment

-   Empathy and compassion
    -   consequences of actions on others
