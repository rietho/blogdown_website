Ideas
* "I'm critical
* My story with mindfulness so far
* How to interpret what I write about mindfulness
    * Share a mix of my experience and what I read about. Beginner. Helps me make sense of it. I'm sure I'll get many things wrong or at least not 100% correct, but that's not the goal.
* Mindfulness characteristics
    * Awareness
    * Curiosity
    * Non identification: not automatically
* Doing mode, being mode
* talk also about non-judgement / judgement
* Books I liked and recommend
